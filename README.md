## Movie-Api React

<p>In this Project we design a web page that uses Movie DB. the movie API return the top four most popular films and display it on the screen when the page is loaded, when the user click on show more button, it will send some informatioin about specific film and it will be shown in pop up box. In addition to that, there will be a search box, so the user can search about any movie and the Movie DB will return information about that movie. The website will be programmed using ReactJs.</p>

<h3>User Journy:</h3>
